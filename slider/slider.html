      <h1>Guardians of the Galaxy</h1>
      <!-- NUMBER -->
      <ul class="slider">
        <li class="item">
          <h3>Star-Lord</h3>
          <img
            src="/dist/images/guardians/guardians-1.webp"
            alt="Character Star-Lord"
          />
          A headstrong intergalactic adventurer, Peter Quill was taken from his
          Earthly home at a young age, growing up in outer space alongside the
          pirate-like Ravagers. As the intrepid Star-Lord, Quill travels the
          cosmos in his spaceship, the Milano, seeking his fortune. Equipped
          with a high- tech blaster and a mix-tape of music from home, Star-Lord
          leads an unlikely team of interstellar misfits – the Guardians of the
          Galaxy – in their attempts to do a little good, a little bad, a little
          of both!
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          <h3>Rocket</h3>
          <img
            src="/dist/images/guardians/guardians-2.webp"
            alt="Character Rocket"
          />
          Though he may look like a common Earth raccoon, the temperamental
          Rocket is in fact a one-of-a-kind genetically produced being,
          originally created on the planet Halfworld. This diminutive, tough-
          talking creature is a master pilot, engineer, marksman, and weapons
          specialist. Previously a small-time thief along with his partner
          Groot, Rocket lends his genius and heavy artillery to the Guardians of
          the Galaxy, unable to resist the call of adventure (and plunder).
        </li>
        <li class="Groot">
          <h3>Rocket</h3>
          <img
            src="/dist/images/guardians/guardians-3.webp"
            alt="Character Groot"
          />
          The last surviving member of a tree-like alien race, Groot is perhaps
          one of the most unusual beings in all the cosmos. Though calm and
          quiet in most instances, he is known to unleash his tremendous
          strength on any enemy foolish enough to threaten his allies,
          particularly his long- time partner in crime, Rocket. Though he can
          only vocalize using the phrase, “I am Groot,” the gentle giant’s
          friends are nevertheless able to understand his exact meaning through
          his subtle inflections.
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          <h3>Gamora</h3>
          <img
            src="/dist/images/guardians/guardians-4.webp"
            alt="Character Gamora"
          />
          Orphaned as a child when the rest of her species was annihilated,
          Gamora was found and raised by the tyrant Thanos, who conditioned her
          to become an unparalleled warrior. Weary of the acts she was forced to
          commit in her would-be father’s name, Gamora later broke free of her
          chains. Teaming up with Star-Lord and his motley crew, the “most
          dangerous woman in the galaxy” now seeks to redeem her past crimes,
          putting her unparalleled skills to use as a member of the Guardians of
          the Galaxy.
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          <h3>Drax</h3>
          <img
            src="/dist/images/guardians/guardians-5.webp"
            alt="Character Drax"
          />
          Fueled by a personal vendetta against those who cost him his family,
          the rough-edged warrior called Drax the Destroyer has room in his life
          for little else besides revenge. To this end, the heavily tattooed
          Drax has long relied upon his proficiency in battle and his
          razor-sharp blades to do his talking for him. After making a tentative
          alliance with the Guardians of the Galaxy, the untamed Drax must learn
          to put the needs of the universe before his own
        </li>

        <li class="item">
          <h3>Mantis</h3>
          <img
            src="/dist/images/guardians/guardians-6.webp"
            alt="Character Mantis"
          />
          An unusual alien being who travels the cosmos seeking truth, Mantis
          has encountered the Guardians of the Galaxy on numerous occasions.
          Though her motives are not always clear, she has proven herself a
          reliable and compassionate ally.
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          <h3>Yondu Udonta</h3>
          <img
            src="/dist/images/guardians/guardians-7.webp"
            alt="Character Yondu Udonta"
          />
          Yondu Udonta acts as leader of the Ravagers, a ruthless army of
          unscrupulous space pirates and mercenaries. Long ago he was hired to
          capture the young earthling Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord, though a
          last-minute change of heart caused Yondu to betray his employer and
          bring Quill into the fold as one of his own, serving almost as a
          surrogate father. Though he occasionally shows faint glimmers of
          compassion, Yondu’s greed more often causes him to betray even his
          closest allies any time the promise of some quick credits is involved.
